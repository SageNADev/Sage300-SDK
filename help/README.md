## Classic Help Files

For Sage 300 2020, a change was made to the Classic (Desktop) SDK to no longer 
update the content of the CHM files delivered in the installation. 

> **In a future release (still to be determined), these files will be removed from the installation.**

The updated help files will be available in the **classic** folder. This provides a better mechanism 
for delivering updated content without having to download/install the entire SDK.
