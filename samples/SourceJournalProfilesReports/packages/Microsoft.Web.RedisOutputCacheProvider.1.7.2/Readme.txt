Microsoft.Web.Redis.RedisOutputCacheProvider Nuget package has been added to your project.

A new <outputCache> entry has been added to your web.config. However, any existing output cache entries will not have been modified. 
If you believe you had an existing outputCache entry, you will need to manually modify the web.config to make the Redis Output Cache Provider as the default.
