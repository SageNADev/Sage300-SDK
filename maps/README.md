# Code Maps

Code Maps is an architectural tool in Visual Studio that generates a graph, like a dependency graph, 
to assist the developer with understanding and viewing the relationships and dependencies of a large 
code base in a visually appealing, dynamic and interactive graphical display.

A code map visualizes code and project relationships and can even be viewed in a tab next to the code 
editor inside of Visual Studio. This allows the developer to see where they are in the map and therefore 
in the hierarchy of the code while in the code itself. 

However, third-party developers, while not having the code associated with a code map delivered
in the SDK, will be able to load one or more code maps into Visual Studio for the purpose of viewing the 
relationships in a graph display.

The code maps included in the SDK are meant as a visual guide to certain important relationships, 
utilities and helper classes. This information is also available in the CoreCommon.chm file provided
in the help folder.
