As part of the framework changes required to handle theme color in
Sage 300c 2020.2, several files need to be altered for the solution to
adapt the changes after the upgrade process.

The upgrade wizard is unable to automatically perform this modification and
therefore this step will require manual modifications.

Any JavaScript file that defines a customized Kendo window needs to be updated
for the customized popup to apply the new theme colors.

Please refer to the 'Theme Color changes' subsection in the Sage 300
Upgrade Guide for 2020.1 to 2020.2 in the docs folder of the Web SDK for
detailed instructions. The samples code may also be used as a guide.
