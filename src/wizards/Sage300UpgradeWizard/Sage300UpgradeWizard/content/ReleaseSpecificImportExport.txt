The Framework was enhanced to contain a common component for 
Import/Export functionality in the web screens.

To implement the import/export functionality, the Business Repository class
will require modifications to the import/export base class along with 
supplying a Business Enity Property or a hierarchy of Business
Enity Properties (for header/detail screens) based upon the composition
of the business wiews.  

The upgrade wizard is unable to automatically perform these
modifications and therefore this step will require manual modifications.

Please refer to the Sage 300 Import/Export Documentation in the docs
folder of the Web SDK. The samples code may also be used as a guide.
